Command line

I'm still grappling with the command line and how it works in with the computer. And my mum still uses a fax, so this is going to be hard.

The command line is a program which allows you to communicate directly with the computer's operating system. The user passes in commands through the command line, which are then processed by the computer. As an example, you could type a command to create a folder, and then another command to create a file within that folder. You could then command the file to be opened using a certain program, such as Atom (a text editor) or a web browser like Chrome.

The command line is exclusively text-based. The is distinct from the "graphical user interface" or "GUI" that we're accustomed to when using personal computers. Windows is a GUI for example - you don't actually type a command to open a file, you just move the pointer of a graphic representation of a file and double click. As an aside, some people theorise that human senses have evolved to see the world as a GUI. For example when we see a snake, we understand this as a threat, and behave accordingly. The "real" snake might look completely different. But our senses have evolved to interpret the world efficiently and the snake is an efficient graphical representation of that threat. These theorists go on to suggest that the real world is likely to look very different to the way we see it - we don't see the "code" behind the snake, just the graphic of the snake.

Terminal commands

mkdir = make a new folder
cd = change directory (folder)
touch = create a new file (I have no idea why the command is "touch")
mv = move or copy something
pwd = print working directory (tell me which folder I'm in, and where that folder is nested within my storage)
ls = list the contents of the folder I'm currently in
git status = tell me what has changed between my local git files and cloud-based git files
git add = ready any new or modified files for adding to the cloud-based storage
git commit = save the modified and new files
git push = add the modified or new files to the cloud-based storage
git pull = import any updates to the cloud-based files to my local storage (useful when working in collaboration with others on a project, and those others may have modified files that I want to work on)
